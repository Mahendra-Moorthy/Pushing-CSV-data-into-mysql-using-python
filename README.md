# Pushing-CSV-data-into-mysql-using-python


Here i created a CSV file and storing the data into mysql using python coding

create_csv.py = created a simple CSV file using python

Internlist.csv = created CSV file by create_csv.py

finalcsv.py = In this file i entered the mysql credentials to login and created a new table then stored the data into it. Here i droped older table and added it newly because if you want to modify or add something in the CSV file it adds to it won't replace. So i droped the older version of table and added the new one.
